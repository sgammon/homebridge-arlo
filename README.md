## Do not merge

Hey, I can help you write this plugin if you are open to it, or at least help diagnose issues. You'll need to enable GitHub Issues for me to easily be able to communicate with you, though. Thank you for doing the work to add 2FA to this plugin, because obviously the original is now broken. I was going to add 2FA SMS support via Twilio as an option when I came across your fork. Would you like to work together? All good if not, have a great day.

## Installation

- Install [config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x).
- Search for "Arlo" on the Plugin Screen of [config-ui-x](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x) .
- Click Install on Homebridge Arlo.

## Configuration

Arlo only allows a single login to each account at a time, as a result, if you
are running Homebridge and the Arlo on the same account... logging in on your
iPhone to view cameras will log out homebridge's Arlo access.

Therefore, It is **highly recommend** to creating an [additional account](https://my.arlo.com/#/registration) in Arlo, just
for homebridge access.
